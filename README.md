## Background

[Cisco DNA Center](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/cloud-systems-management/dna-center/index.html) is a centralized network control and management dashboard for Cisco DNA, an intent-based networking solution.

This project provides a sample Python application and client libraries to access the Platform REST APIs for the [Python](https://www.python.org) language using the latest [Cisco DNA Center SDK](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/dna-center/#!python-sdk-getting-started/installation)

⚠️ This code repo is intended to follow my Cisco DNA Center SDK [Blog Series](https://blogs.cisco.com/author/kareemiskander)
